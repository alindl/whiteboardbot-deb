Description: Whiteboard capture, enhancement and sharing tool
 WhiteboardBot implements a system that uses a Raspberry Pi 3/4, or similar
 devices, to plug in one or a set of cameras that would be able to capture
 a white- or blackboard. This capture is triggered by a BLE remote.
 After taking the picture, the files can automatically be sent to Slack
 (to a specific channel or user), to one or several email addresses or
 to a arbitrary mix of those.
 .
 There is also an optional enhancement feature for those pictures, such as
 whiteboard enhancement, lens distortion fix and cropping. It also has an
 optional feedback system through audio and visuals.
 .
 All those settings can be set, cameras, buttons and emails can be
 dynamically added and removed. Buttons can be configured, so that pressing a
 specific button will result in sharing through different channels.
 This is done through a configuration menu, which is a website that is locally
 reachable through whiteboardbot.local.
